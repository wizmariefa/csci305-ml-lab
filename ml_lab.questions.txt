Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. Function f adds one to each of the numbers passed in and saves it as an int set.

3. This is simply saying that fun f takes a set and returns a set.

4. This is saying that for each x that becomes xs, we add one before saving it as xs.

5.

6.

7.

8.

9.

10.

11. Because it's a "tell me what to do" language, the functions tend to be
    smaller and less complex than some language like Java or Python.

12. Personally, I think the lack of documentation on ML is pretty annoying. I
    had a hard time finding resources and answers other than the class slides
    and examples posted for the class, or lectures for classes that similarly
    taught ML.

13. I did not particularly-- though it was interesting to learn about declarative
    languages, I didn't feel like I really got much out of this lab that I will
    be using later on in my career. I didn't like the lack of documentation on the
    language or the fact that it was next to impossible to find helpful resources.

14. I spent about 8 or 10 hours on this lab. Most of it was learning syntax of ML,
    which was frustrating, because it wasn't like I spent most of my time writing
    code like I would with Java/Python. I spent my time trying to figure out how
    to do simple things with this language.

15. Because ML is a research language and I'm not anticipating any graduate
    school in my future, I don't see my self using ML for much of anything,
    personally.
